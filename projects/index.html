        <h2>Password Generator (completed)</h2>
        <p class="description">This user friendly password generator can create very strong passwords, that are virtually impossible to crack. The passwords are generated on your device and aren't stored anywhere.</p>
        <p class= "description">I managed to complete the generator part of this program in 1 minute and 59 seconds. The hard part was the HTML & CSS, which took me several days to make look at least presentable.</p>
