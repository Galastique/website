        <p>
            On here, you can find all of my programming related projects that I've been working on recently. Every single item that you can find on the projects tab are projects that I've worked on entirely on my own. <br><br>

            The ideas for most of them aren't unique at all, but I programmed them without basing myself on anything, other than logic. The code is far from perfect, but every now and then I go back to make some changes, improvements as well as new additions. <br><br>

            The source code for everything is available on that same projects tab, as well as on my GitHub account, which you can access through the social tab. <br><br>

            If you wish to contact me, feel free to visit one of the links available in that same social tab. I hope you have an excellent day :)
