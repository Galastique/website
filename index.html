    <h1>Welcome stranger!</h1>
    <p>This is my very own website, that I built in HTML, CSS and with a bit of JavaScript, entirely on my own. It contains my frontend programming projects, as well as information about them. You can also find links to several of my social media, in addition to my email if you ever wish to contact me.</p>
